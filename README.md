# Integrated-E_learning-And-Library_Managment-System
m excited to present my academic project: Integrated E-Learning and Library Management System, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This project blends e-learning and library management into a unified platform, offering users an intuitive experience.

Key Features:
📚 Library Management: Barcode generation, book cataloging, borrowing, and returns.
🎓 E-Learning Platform: Course creation, assignment management, and student progress tracking.
🔐 Secure Authentication: Password encryption using bcrypt and session handling with express-session.
✉️ Email Notifications: Automated alerts for users via nodemailer.
💻 Responsive UI: Built using Bootstrap with icons from FontAwesome.

Database:
MongoDB:
Flexible schema design for handling various data types such as user profiles, courses, and library records.
Efficient querying and indexing for fast data retrieval.
Scalability to handle a growing number of users and data.

Tech Stack & Libraries:

React Libraries:
axios – for API requests
react-router-dom – for routing
bwip-js & jsbarcode – for generating barcodes
react-icons – for UI icons
bootstrap – for responsive styling

Node.js Libraries:
express – for RESTful APIs
mongoose – for MongoDB data modeling
multer – for handling file uploads
nodemailer – for sending emails
bcrypt – for password hashing
cors – for enabling cross-origin resource sharing
nodemon – for automatic server restarts during development
This project has significantly boosted my understanding of full-stack development and scalable web application architecture. I'm excited to apply these skills to real-world challenges!
Let’s connect and collaborate! 🚀
